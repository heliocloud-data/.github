## Greetings 👋

Welcome to the HelioCloud:  An open-source, cloud-base analytics and data platform for empowering heliophysics research. You probably came here by way of our public site https://heliocloud.org,  but if not we suggest you stop there first and take a look around.

Like other great open-souce projects, we've chose to host the HelioCloud codebase on GitHub to maximize accesibility for the HelioPhysics community, encouraging dialogue, participation and community code contributions.  Please dive in and tell us what you think!


## TODO:  Sections we will be adding
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - Did you know Sandy is a game designer?  Did you know Parker Solar Probe is the fastest object ever built by humans?
